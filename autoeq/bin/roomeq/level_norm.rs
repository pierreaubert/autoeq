//! Level normalization logic for room EQ
//!
//! Note: Normalization functions are currently unused because the optimizer
//! effectively handles level differences between drivers. The gains found by
//! the optimizer represent the actual adjustments needed to achieve a flat
//! combined response, regardless of whether inputs are normalized.
//!
//! This module is kept for potential future use and reference.
