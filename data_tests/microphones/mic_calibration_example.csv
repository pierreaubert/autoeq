# Example microphone calibration file for sotf_recorder
# Format: frequency_hz,spl_db
# SPL deviation: positive = mic reads louder than actual, negative = mic reads quieter
#
# This file represents the microphone's frequency response deviation from flat.
# When used with --microphone-compensation, the inverse is applied to measurements:
#   true_spl = measured_spl - mic_deviation
#
# Example data: a microphone with typical response characteristics
# - Slight roll-off below 100 Hz (-2 dB at 20 Hz)
# - Flat from 100-5000 Hz
# - Presence peak at 8 kHz (+3 dB)
# - Roll-off above 15 kHz
